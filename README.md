# Movie-Recommender-System

My Databricks notebook for this recommender system system can be found @ https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/5441450466904902/3920239539707793/3150505834571580/latest.html

In a Databricks notebook we will develop an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) Recommender System in PySpark for movies using a Movie Lens dataset with 100,000 ratings for 9,000 movies by 600 users. The data was collected during years 1996 to 2018. The two data files we will import and use are the 'movies.csv' file that contains movieId,title, and genres data and 'ratings.csv' that contains userId,movieId,rating, and timestamp data. More information on this dataset can be found at http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html

I have created this notebook in Databricks because I wanted to get familiar with this system for big data analysis using Apache Spark.
